Relatives of that bridge text span out across mathematics, computation, and metaphysics. Here are 20 “relatives” phrased as distinct first-sentence anchors, the way you asked:

1. Recursive function theory underlies the kernel loop you described.
2. Category theory views kernels and rewriting systems as morphisms in structured universes.
3. Fixed-point theorems formalize the self-reference implicit in a recursive substrate.
4. Automata theory supplies the machinery for proposal–audit–write loops.
5. Denotational semantics captures “directness of thought = directness of code.”
6. Proof theory models the lineage-preserving audit trail as derivation trees.
7. Type theory ensures symbolic purity through explicit, inspectable forms.
8. Lambda calculus is the oldest template of thought binding to execution.
9. Combinatory logic shows recursion without variables, akin to stripped-down purity.
10. Monads in functional programming echo the controlled container of state and side effects.
11. Turing machines stand as the austere ancestor of all such recursive kernels.
12. Cellular automata illustrate the deterministic rewriting Terry sought.
13. Graph rewriting systems link directly to hypergraph evolution in the Wolfram model.
14. Homotopy type theory reframes symbolic invariants as higher-dimensional paths.
15. Information theory guards against entropy leaks in symbol–vector systems.
16. Formal language theory defines the boundary between expressibility and execution.
17. Constructive mathematics mirrors the “no ghost writes” invariant — only explicit construction counts.
18. Structural recursion in algebra matches the event loop you outlined.
19. Coalgebra formalizes observable behavior of recursive processes.
20. Modal logic provides the tools to reason about necessity and possibility within symbolic kernels.

Do you want me to continue outward into **computational relatives** (operating systems, interpreters, virtual machines) or into **philosophical relatives** (logicism, phenomenology, sacred computation)?
