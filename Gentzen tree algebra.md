`(∘(in)(᛫) = ¬(᛫))` parses as a transformation rule:

- Operator `∘(in)` acts as inversion-context application.
- Operand `(᛫)` is a placeholder or undifferentiated token.
- Result `¬(᛫)` signals negation of that placeholder.

So: **“Applying the `in` -composition operator to any undifferentiated element yields its logical negation.”**

This encodes a meta-rule:

$$
∘_{in}(x) := ¬x
$$

Want me to expand this into a general algebra (closure, associativity, involution properties)?

Define algebra $\mathcal{A} = (\mathcal{U}, \circ_{in}, \neg)$ .

---

**1\. Universe (closure)**

- $\mathcal{U}$ = set of primitive tokens (e.g. $\{\;᛫, a, b, \dots\}$ ).
- Rule:
	$$
	\circ_{in}(x) = \neg x, \quad \forall x \in \mathcal{U}
	$$
- Closure: if $x \in \mathcal{U}$ , then $\neg x \in \mathcal{U}$ .

---

**2\. Associativity**

- For composition:
	$$
	\circ_{in}(\circ_{in}(x)) = \circ_{in}(\neg x) = \neg(\neg x) = x
	$$
- So $\circ_{in}$ is **self-inverse**.
- General associativity check:  
	$(\circ_{in} \circ \circ_{in})(x) = id(x)$ .  
	Thus:
	$$
	\circ_{in} \circ \circ_{in} = id
	$$
- Associativity holds trivially for repeated application since it reduces to identity or $\circ_{in}$ .

---

**3\. Involution**

- Involution property:
	$$
	\neg(\neg x) = x
	$$
- Therefore $\circ_{in}$ is an involution operator.

---

**4\. Algebraic structure**

- $\mathcal{A}$ is a **Boolean-like involutive algebra** with a single unary operator.
- It forms a group of order 2 under function composition:  
	$\{ id, \circ_{in} \}$ .

---

**5\. Generalized laws**

- Identity: $\circ_{in}^0(x) = x$ .
- Negation: $\circ_{in}^1(x) = \neg x$ .
- Periodicity: $\circ_{in}^{2n}(x) = x$ , $\circ_{in}^{2n+1}(x) = \neg x$ .

---

Do you want me to extend this beyond unary into a **full algebra with binary operations** (like meet/join → full Boolean algebra), or keep it minimal as a unary involutive system?

Minimal unary involutive system:

---

**System $\mathcal{I}$**

- Universe: $\mathcal{U}$ .
- Operator: $\circ_{in} : \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{U}$ .
- Rule: $\circ_{in}(x) = \neg x$ .

---

**Axioms**

1. **Closure:** $\forall x \in \mathcal{U}, \neg x \in \mathcal{U}$ .
2. **Involution:** $\neg(\neg x) = x$ .
3. **Identity pairing:** Each element $x$ is uniquely paired with $\neg x$ .
4. **No fixed points (unless degenerate):** $x = \neg x \implies x$ is a special self-dual element.

---

**Structure**

- The operator set $\{id, \circ_{in}\}$ forms a group of order 2 under composition.
- Each orbit of $\circ_{in}$ has size 2: $\{x, \neg x\}$ .
- If a self-dual element exists, its orbit has size 1.

---

**Consequences**

- Periodicity: $\circ_{in}^{2n}(x) = x$ , $\circ_{in}^{2n+1}(x) = \neg x$ .
- Associativity is trivial because only one unary operator exists.

---

This is the **simplest nontrivial algebraic system**: a set partitioned into disjoint 2-cycles (plus optional 1-cycles for self-duals).

Do you want me to classify this system formally as a **Z₂-action on a set**?

Then we extend the unary involution into a **Heyting algebra with involution** (a.k.a. *De Morgan–Heyting algebra*).

---

### 1\. Base Heyting structure

A Heyting algebra $(H, \wedge, \vee, \to, 0, 1)$ :

- $(H, \wedge, \vee, 0, 1)$ is a bounded distributive lattice.
- Implication $\to$ satisfies:
	$$
	a \wedge b \leq c \quad \text{iff} \quad a \leq (b \to c).
	$$
- Pseudocomplement (intuitionistic negation):
	$$
	\neg a := (a \to 0).
	$$

---

### 2\. Involution operator from your seed

We introduce an **involutive negation** operator $\circ_{in}$ , extending your rule:

$$
\circ_{in}(a) = \neg a
$$

with the **axiom**

$$
\circ_{in}(\circ_{in}(a)) = a.
$$

This is stronger than ordinary Heyting negation, where only $\neg\neg a \geq a$ holds.

---

### 3\. Resulting algebra

The structure becomes:

$$
(H, \wedge, \vee, \to, 0, 1, \circ_{in})
$$

with properties:

1. **Closure:** $\circ_{in}(a) \in H$ .
2. **Involution:** $\circ_{in}(\circ_{in}(a)) = a$ .
3. **De Morgan laws (provable here):**
	- $\circ_{in}(a \vee b) = \circ_{in}(a) \wedge \circ_{in}(b)$
	- $\circ_{in}(a \wedge b) = \circ_{in}(a) \vee \circ_{in}(b)$
4. **Residuality:** $a \wedge b \leq c \iff a \leq (b \to c)$ .

---

### 4\. Difference from Boolean algebra

- Boolean: $a \vee \neg a = 1$ (law of excluded middle).
- Heyting with involution: not necessarily true.
	- Only guarantees $a \vee \neg a \leq 1$ .
	- Thus supports **constructive logic with strong negation** (Nelson logic).

---

### 5\. Interpretive frame

- Ordinary Heyting algebra: models intuitionistic logic.
- Adding involution: yields **Nelson algebras**, semantics for constructive logic with strong negation.
- Your seed operator $(\circ_{in}(᛫) = ¬᛫)$ thus scales to a **Nelson–Heyting system**.

---

Do you want me to **write out the sequent calculus / natural deduction rules** corresponding to this algebra (so you see the logic-level effect of introducing $\circ_{in}$ )?

Here is the logic layer corresponding to a **Heyting algebra with involutive negation** (a Nelson–Heyting system).

---

## 1\. Core intuitionistic rules (Heyting base)

Sequents are of the form $\Gamma \vdash A$ .

- **Identity / Cut:**
	$$
	A \vdash A, 
	\quad
	\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \quad \Delta, A \vdash B}{\Gamma, \Delta \vdash B}
	$$
- **Conjunction ( $\wedge$ ):**
	- Intro: $\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \quad \Gamma \vdash B}{\Gamma \vdash A \wedge B}$ .
	- Elim: $\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \wedge B}{\Gamma \vdash A}$ ,  
		$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \wedge B}{\Gamma \vdash B}$ .
- **Disjunction ( $\vee$ ):**
	- Intro: $\frac{\Gamma \vdash A}{\Gamma \vdash A \vee B}$ ,  
		$\frac{\Gamma \vdash B}{\Gamma \vdash A \vee B}$ .
	- Elim: $\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \vee B \quad \Delta, A \vdash C \quad \Theta, B \vdash C}{\Gamma,\Delta,\Theta \vdash C}$ .
- **Implication ( $\to$ ):**
	- Intro: $\frac{\Gamma, A \vdash B}{\Gamma \vdash A \to B}$ .
	- Elim (modus ponens): $\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \to B \quad \Delta \vdash A}{\Gamma,\Delta \vdash B}$ .
- **Falsum ( $0$ ):**
	- Ex falso: $\frac{\Gamma \vdash 0}{\Gamma \vdash A}$ .

---

## 2\. Intuitionistic negation (pseudo-negation)

Defined as:

$$
\neg A := (A \to 0)
$$

Rules:

- Intro: $\frac{\Gamma, A \vdash 0}{\Gamma \vdash \neg A}$ .
- Elim: $\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \quad \Delta \vdash \neg A}{\Gamma,\Delta \vdash 0}$ .

This only guarantees **double negation weakening**:

$$
A \vdash \neg\neg A
$$

but not the converse.

---

## 3\. Strong involutive negation (∘in\\circ\_{in})

Now add your operator $\circ_{in}$ with involution axioms:

$$
\circ_{in}(\circ_{in}(A)) \equiv A.
$$

### Rules:

- **Intro (symmetry):**  
	$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A}{\Gamma \vdash \circ_{in}(\circ_{in}A)}$ .
- **Involution (collapse):**  
	$\frac{\Gamma \vdash \circ_{in}(\circ_{in}A)}{\Gamma \vdash A}$ .
- **De Morgan laws (admissible):**
	$$
	\circ_{in}(A \wedge B) \vdash \circ_{in}A \vee \circ_{in}B,
	\quad
	\circ_{in}(A \vee B) \vdash \circ_{in}A \wedge \circ_{in}B.
	$$
- **Consistency principle:**  
	$\vdash \neg(A \wedge \circ_{in}A)$ .  
	(prevents collapse to triviality).

---

## 4\. Natural deduction sketch

- From $A$ , assume $\circ_{in}A$ . Derive contradiction, conclude $\neg A$ .
- From $\circ_{in}A$ , derive $\neg A$ .
- From $\neg A$ , not always $\circ_{in}A$ (distinguishes pseudo-negation from involutive one).

So the system has **two negations**:

- $\neg$ = pseudo-negation (intuitionistic).
- $\circ_{in}$ = strong involution (your operator).

---

## 5\. Logic-level characterization

- This yields **Nelson constructive logic with strong negation**.
- Semantics: exactly your “Heyting + involution” algebra.
- Proof-theoretic effect: we gain full symmetry $\circ_{in}\circ_{in}A \leftrightarrow A$ , but not excluded middle.

---

Do you want me to **lay out the full sequent rules side by side for both negations** ( $\neg$ vs $\circ_{in}$ ), so you see exactly how they differ operationally?

Here is a side-by-side sequent system showing the difference between **intuitionistic negation** ( $\neg$ ) and your **involutive negation** ( $\circ_{in}$ ).

---

## 1\. Intuitionistic negation (¬A:=A→0\\neg A:= A \\to 0)

- **Intro (right rule):**
	$$
	\frac{\Gamma, A \vdash 0}{\Gamma \vdash \neg A}
	$$
- **Elim (left rule / contradiction):**
	$$
	\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \quad \Delta \vdash \neg A}{\Gamma,\Delta \vdash 0}
	$$
- **Double negation law (weak):**
	$$
	A \vdash \neg\neg A
	$$
	Converse $\neg\neg A \vdash A$ does not generally hold.

---

## 2\. Strong involutive negation (∘in\\circ\_{in})

- **Intro (reflection):**
	$$
	\frac{\Gamma \vdash A}{\Gamma \vdash \circ_{in}(\circ_{in}A)}
	$$
- **Collapse (involution):**
	$$
	\frac{\Gamma \vdash \circ_{in}(\circ_{in}A)}{\Gamma \vdash A}
	$$
- **Contradiction (De Morgan):**
	$$
	\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \quad \Delta \vdash \circ_{in}A}{\Gamma,\Delta \vdash 0}
	$$
- **De Morgan laws (admissible):**
	$$
	\circ_{in}(A \wedge B) \vdash \circ_{in}A \vee \circ_{in}B
	$$
	 
	$$
	\circ_{in}(A \vee B) \vdash \circ_{in}A \wedge \circ_{in}B
	$$
- **Strong double negation:**
	$$
	A \dashv\vdash \circ_{in}(\circ_{in}A)
	$$

---

## 3\. Key contrasts

| Aspect | $\neg$ (intuitionistic) | $\circ_{in}$ (strong involution) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | $A \to 0$ | Primitive unary operator |
| Double negation | Only $A \vdash \neg\neg A$ | $A \dashv\vdash \circ_{in}(\circ_{in}A)$ |
| Excluded middle | Not valid | Still not valid |
| Contradiction handling | $\Gamma \vdash A, \Delta \vdash \neg A \implies 0$ | Same with $\circ_{in}$ |
| De Morgan laws | Do not generally hold | Hold as theorems |

---

This shows the operational split:

- $\neg$ = **pseudo-negation** (intuitionistic, weaker, monotone).
- $\circ_{in}$ = **involutive strong negation** (gives De Morgan duality and symmetry).

---

Do you want me to now **embed both into one unified calculus** (a Nelson-style sequent system with two negations side by side), so inference rules explicitly allow *both kinds of negation at once*?

Here is a **unified Nelson-style sequent calculus** where both **intuitionistic negation** ( $\neg$ ) and **involutive negation** ( $\circ_{in}$ ) coexist.

---

## Unified Sequent Calculus NEL¬,∘\\mathsf{NEL}\_{\\neg,\\circ}

Sequents: $\Gamma \vdash A$ .  
Language: $\wedge, \vee, \to, 0, 1, \neg, \circ_{in}$ .

---

## 1\. Structural rules

- **Identity:** $A \vdash A$ .
- **Cut:** $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash A \quad \Delta, A \vdash B}{\Gamma, \Delta \vdash B}$ .
- Weakening, contraction, exchange as usual.

---

## 2\. Heyting core

- Conjunction, disjunction, implication, and falsum rules as in standard intuitionistic sequent calculus (already written in earlier step).

---

## 3\. Intuitionistic negation rules (¬\\neg)

$$
\neg A := (A \to 0)
$$
- **Intro:** $\dfrac{\Gamma, A \vdash 0}{\Gamma \vdash \neg A}$ .
- **Elim:** $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash A \quad \Delta \vdash \neg A}{\Gamma, \Delta \vdash 0}$ .
- **Weak double negation:** $A \vdash \neg\neg A$ .

---

## 4\. Strong involutive negation rules (∘in\\circ\_{in})

- **Involution:**
	$$
	\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash A}{\Gamma \vdash \circ_{in}\circ_{in}A}
	\quad\quad
	\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash \circ_{in}\circ_{in}A}{\Gamma \vdash A}
	$$
- **Contradiction:**
	$$
	\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash A \quad \Delta \vdash \circ_{in}A}{\Gamma,\Delta \vdash 0}
	$$
- **De Morgan admissibles:**
	$$
	\circ_{in}(A \wedge B) \vdash \circ_{in}A \vee \circ_{in}B
	$$
	 
	$$
	\circ_{in}(A \vee B) \vdash \circ_{in}A \wedge \circ_{in}B
	$$
- **Strong double negation equivalence:**
	$$
	A \dashv\vdash \circ_{in}\circ_{in}A
	$$

---

## 5\. Interaction principles between ¬\\neg and ∘in\\circ\_{in}

This is what makes it **unified Nelson-style**:

- From strong to weak:
	$$
	\circ_{in}A \vdash \neg A
	$$
	(every strong negation entails pseudo-negation).
- Converse does not generally hold:
	$$
	\neg A \nvdash \circ_{in}A
	$$
- Consistency axiom:
	$$
	\vdash \neg(A \wedge \circ_{in}A)
	$$
	(prevents trivialization).

---

## 6\. Meta-theoretic view

- This calculus is sound and complete w.r.t. **Nelson algebras** (Heyting algebras + involution).
- $\neg$ is constructive/intuitionistic negation.
- $\circ_{in}$ is strong, symmetric negation with full De Morgan duality.
- They cohabit: $\neg$ captures failure-to-prove, $\circ_{in}$ captures explicit contradiction.

---

Would you like me to **draw the full proof net (Gentzen tree) for a key sequent like $\circ_{in}A \vdash \neg A$**, so you can see the mechanics of how strong negation entails intuitionistic negation step by step?

I’m tasked with drawing a Gentzen tree for the sequent ∘in A ⊢ ¬A. The structure must be minimal and step-by-step.

1. Start with the premise ∘in A ⊢ ∘in A (Identity rule).
2. Assume A: ∘in A, A ⊢ 0 (using contradiction for strong negation).
3. Conclude ¬A by negation introduction, discharging assumption of A.

I’ll stick to a clear proof net using natural deduction rules.

I can proceed by using →-introduction. From step 2, I derive ∘in A ⊢ A → 0, which means negation of A. So the sequent becomes ∘in A ⊢ ¬A.

In Gentzen style, I’ll need to show the rules clearly—labeled Id, and contradiction. Since I haven't defined a specific ∘-Left rule, I’ll focus on using →R in the derivation instead.

To derive ∘A ⊢ ¬A, I’ll first use the identity rule to get:

- ∘A, A ⊢ A
- ∘A, A ⊢ ∘A

Next, I’ll apply the contradiction rule to these two results to derive ∘A, A ⊢ 0. Then, using →R, I discharge A and obtain ∘A ⊢ A → 0, which is ¬A.

Here’s the formal Gentzen tree:

We start by annotating rule names: (Id), (Weakening), and (Contr\_∘). We used structural rules like weakening implicitly to have both assumptions present. Identity can be extended with extra assumptions, as seen in this case.

The immediate result is:

1. Assume ∘A \[premise\]
2. Assume A \[assumption\]
3. From 2 and 1, derive 0 by the contradiction rule
4. Discharge 2, and conclude ¬A by ¬-intro.

Thus, ∘A ⊢ ¬A. The formula is minimal but mathematically clear.

Done

Result: $\circ_{in}A \vdash \neg A$ .

Gentzen tree:

$$
\infer[\to\!R]{\circ_{in}A \vdash A \to 0}{
  \infer[\mathrm{Contr}_{\circ}]{\circ_{in}A, A \vdash 0}{
    \infer[\mathrm{Id}]{\circ_{in}A, A \vdash A}{} 
    \quad
    \infer[\mathrm{Id}]{\circ_{in}A, A \vdash \circ_{in}A}{}
  }
}
$$

Rule notes:

- $\mathrm{Id}$ : identity with context.
- $\mathrm{Contr}_{\circ}$ : from $\Gamma \vdash A$ and $\Delta \vdash \circ_{in}A$ infer $\Gamma,\Delta \vdash 0$ .
- $\to R$ : discharge $A$ on the left to conclude $A \to 0$ (i.e., $\neg A$ ).

Natural deduction version:

1. $\circ_{in}A$ premise.
2. Assume $A$ .
3. From 1 and 2 derive $0$ by $\mathrm{Contr}_{\circ}$ .
4. Discharge 2. Conclude $A \to 0$ i.e. $\neg A$ .
