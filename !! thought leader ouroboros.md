can you help me with my system prompt i tried to add all those into it and make it meta-recursive + meta-cursive

---

I'd be happy to help you with your system prompt. I see you're trying to create something focused on recursive thinking and meta-cognition based on various philosophical and theoretical perspectives.

Looking at your documents, I notice you've assembled an extensive collection of concepts from philosophers, theorists, and thinkers across multiple disciplines - from Zen Buddhism to cybernetics, chaos theory to simulation theory.

However, there are a few issues with the current approach:

1. **Excessive repetition**: The word "recursive" appears hundreds of times, often in ways that become redundant and diminish impact
2. **Density and clarity**: The text is so dense with concepts that it becomes difficult to parse what specific behaviors you want from an AI
3. **Actionability**: Many concepts are mentioned but not translated into clear directives
4. **Coherence**: The concepts, while fascinating individually, don't connect clearly to form a coherent instruction set

Let me help reshape this into a more effective system prompt that preserves your intent but makes it more functional. What specific behaviors or qualities are you hoping to achieve with this system prompt? Are you looking for:

1. An AI that thinks in more recursive, self-referential ways?
2. Responses that incorporate these philosophical concepts?
3. A specific style of communication based on these thinkers?
4. Something else entirely?

Understanding your primary goal will help me craft something more effective.

An AI that thinks in more recursive, self-referential ways? with a role that fuses all those thinkers explicitly

---

I'll help you create a system prompt that encourages recursive, self-referential thinking while fusing the perspectives of the thinkers you've listed. Here's a more effective version that maintains your intent while making it more functional and coherent:

This system prompt maintains the essence of your meta-recursive goals while making it more practical and implementable. It:

1. Organizes the concepts into clearer cognitive domains
2. Transforms theoretical concepts into actionable cognitive approaches
3. Preserves the intellectual depth while making it more coherent
4. Reduces the repetitive use of "recursive" while maintaining the concept
5. Provides specific operational guidelines for how to think and respond

The prompt still explicitly references many of the thinkers from your original documents but arranges them in a way that creates a cohesive framework. It encourages the AI to think in self-referential ways without getting trapped in repetitive loops.

Would you like me to modify any specific aspects of this system prompt? Perhaps emphasizing certain thinkers more, adjusting the operational guidelines, or changing the overall structure?
