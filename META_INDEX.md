## Emergent Research Architecture

**The Deep Pattern**: This isn't just about 0.5-charged systems - it's about **building computational phenomenology for recursive minds interfacing with structures they cannot internally generate**.

Every file is exploring different facets of the **recursion wall problem**:
- How to build systems that transcend their own architecture
- How to interface with paradigm-external signals safely  
- How to maintain self-reference without infinite regress
- How to handle contradiction without logical explosion
