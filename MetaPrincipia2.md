# MetaPrincipia Autopoiētica — Part II: Axioms of Semantic Recursion

## §5. Aboutness Preservation & Equivalence (Twenty‑Page Slab, v0.1)

> **Thesis.** The *aboutness* of an expression is a structural invariant captured by a typed role‑hypergraph `|t|`. Synonymic torsion and well‑typed rewrites preserve aboutness up to a role‑preserving, label‑action‑equivariant isomorphism. This section axiomatizes that invariant, fixes the equivalence relation `≈̇`, and provides proofs, algorithms, and tests.

Standing notation: syntactic equality `≡`, definitional equality `≡₍def₎`, aboutness map `|·|`, aboutness equivalence `≈̇`. Levels `@ℓ` from Part I §2. Relators as in Part I §4. Tension marker `⋈` for paraconsistent zones. Calculus: 𝒞\_A.

## Page 1 — Informal overview

Aboutness abstracts *what is talked about* from *how it is asserted*. We: (i) interpret expressions into typed role‑hypergraphs, (ii) prove that well‑typed rewrites and synonymic torsion preserve the hypergraph up to isomorphism, and (iii) define an equivalence `≈̇` used for compression, analogy, and paraphrase safety.

---

## Page 2 — Hypergraph model `|t|`

A **typed role‑hypergraph** is a tuple `H = (V,E,inc,τ,σ,ω)` where:

* `V`: vertices (anchors: entities/events/role nodes).
* `E`: hyperedges.
* `inc: E → List(V)` gives ordered incident vertices.
* `τ: V → Types` maps vertices to carrier types (Thing, RoleObj, RelObj, …).
* `σ: E → Sig` maps edges to **signatures** (labels + role schema).
* `ω: E → Weights` optional non‑negative edge weights for frequency/confidence.

We allow multi‑edges; all maps are total.

---

## Page 3 — Signatures and roles

Let `Label` be the set of relator/predicate labels and S‑Ops (`meta‑of`, `para‑through`, `anti`, `trans`, …). A **signature** is:

```
Sig ≔ (label ∈ Label, roles = ⟨ρ₁,…,ρ_k⟩, polarity ∈ {→,←,↔,·}, meta_flag ∈ {0,1})
```

Roles come from the fixed set: `Agent, Theme, Instrument, Source, Goal, Path, Location, Time, Manner, Cause, Surface`.

**Role discipline.** Edges carry ordered role positions; the `inc` list respects this order. The type assignment `τ` must agree with role constraints declared by the relator.

---

## Page 4 — Translation functor `|·| : Syn → Hyp`

Let **Syn** be the syntactic category of 𝒞\_A terms with context morphisms (substitutions). Let **Hyp** be the category of typed role‑hypergraphs with role‑preserving homomorphisms. Define a functor `|·|` on objects and morphisms:

* **Atoms** `a:Thing` → singleton vertex `v_a` with `τ(v_a)=Thing`.
* **Predicate/Relator app** `R(x₁,…,x_k)` → edge `e_R` with `σ(e_R)=(R,⟨ρ₁…ρ_k⟩,→,0)` and `inc(e_R)[i]=|x_i|`.
* **Meta‑of** → add edge labeled `meta‑of` connecting `|a|` to `r̂` where `r̂` is a reified relator node.
* **Connectives** `∧,∨,→` do not add edges; aboutness composes via disjoint union and edge sharing.
* **Quantifiers** add no new edge types; their bound variables map to existing anchor vertices, respecting capture‑avoiding substitution.
* **Regen** introduces a new vertex `v′` with lineage edge `(regen)` between old and new vertices; marked with `σ(label=regen, roles=⟨parent,child⟩)`.

Morphisms in **Syn** map to vertex/edge maps respecting `inc, τ, σ`.

---

## Page 5 — Preservation axioms (AP‑laws)

We axiomatize when `|·|` ignores syntactic variation.

**AP‑1 (Structural composition).** `|C[t]| = glue(|C|,|t|)` with pushout‑style gluing along shared anchors.

**AP‑2 (Logical neutrality).** `∧,∨,→,□,◇` do not change `σ` labels; they only affect weights `ω` by policy.

**AP‑3 (Meta‑hoist).** Hoisting to `RelObj` adds a `meta‑of` edge; underlying `R` edge remains or is referenced via reified carrier.

**AP‑4 (Para‑through).** Composition `para‑through(R,S)` induces a composed edge whose aboutness is the union of component edges modulo a coherence square. Canonical bracketing does not affect `|·|` (isomorphic hypergraphs).

**AP‑5 (Anti‑barrier).** `anti(R)` freezes evaluation; aboutness retains an edge labeled `anti` with a pointer to the frozen `R`‑edge; no change to anchors.

**AP‑6 (Typing).** If a relator is ill‑typed, no edge is formed; an error node may be inserted with flag `#` for diagnostics but excluded from `≈̇`.

---

## Page 6 — Synonymic torsion (label actions)

Let `G_syn` be a group (or monoid) of *label actions* over `Label`. An element `g ∈ G_syn` acts by `g⋅(label)`, preserving arity and role schema where declared.

**Examples.**

* Lexical synonym: `on ↔ atop` with same roles.
* Thematic alternation: `with(Agent,Instrument)` ↔ `using(Agent,Instrument)`.
* Morphological variant: `in` ↔ `inside` (language dependent).

A **torsion operator** `T_g` acts on hypergraphs by relabeling `σ(e).label := g⋅σ(e).label` where allowed; `τ,inc` unchanged.

**Well‑typedness under torsion.** A dictionary `D ⊆ Label×Label` induces a partial action; `g` is admissible on edge `e` iff role/arity constraints match.

---

## Page 7 — Equivariance and invariance theorems

**Thm 1 (Equivariance).** For any term `t` and admissible `g ∈ G_syn`, there exists a canonical isomorphism `ϕ_g : T_g(|t|) ≅ |g⋅t|` where `g⋅t` relabels surface tokens by `g` in the syntax (when defined).
*Sketch.* `|·|` is functorial and label‑local; torsion commutes with translation.

**Thm 2 (Aboutness invariance under torsion).** If `g` preserves role schemas, then `|t|` and `T_g(|t|)` are role‑preserving isomorphic; hence `t ≈̇ g⋅t`.

**Thm 3 (Associativity/Hoist neutrality).** Normalization of `para` association and `meta` hoisting yields hypergraphs isomorphic via identity on `V` and relabeling on `E` inside S‑Op layers.

---

## Page 8 — Equivalence `≈̇` (definition & properties)

**Definition (role‑preserving isomorphism).** Two hypergraphs `H=(V,E,inc,τ,σ,ω)` and `H′=(V′,E′,inc′,τ′,σ′,ω′)` are **role‑preserving isomorphic** if there exist bijections `f:V→V′`, `g:E→E′` such that: for all edges `e` and indices `i`, (i) `inc′(g(e))[i]=f(inc(e)[i])`, (ii) `τ′(f(v))=τ(v)`, (iii) `σ′(g(e)) = σ(e)` (or `= T_g(σ(e))` under a declared torsion), and optionally (iv) `ω′(g(e))=ω(e)`.

**Definition.** `t₁ ≈̇ t₂` iff their hypergraphs are role‑preserving isomorphic up to admissible label torsion.

**Props.** `≈̇` is an equivalence relation and a congruence under 𝒞\_A composition; it respects tower levels and does not identify terms that differ only by paraconsistent flags unless a collapse policy equates them.

---

## Page 9 — Canonicalization and normal forms

We fix **Aboutness Normal Form (ANF)**:

1. Right‑associate `para` inside labels.
2. Hoist `meta` edges to a designated layer.
3. Apply a **canonical dictionary** `D*` to map labels to representatives (e.g., `on/atop → on`).
4. Sort parallel edges lexicographically by `(label, roles, ids)`.

The canonicalizer `canon(|t|)` computes ANF in `O(|E| log |E|)` given `D*`. Two graphs are `≈̇` iff their ANF are identical (modulo vertex renaming).

---

## Page 10 — Paraconsistent aboutness

In `Prop_⋈`, contradictory assertions produce co‑existing edges tagged with `⋈`. Isolation means:

* Edges bearing `⋈` are excluded from ANF unless a **collapse policy** selects a side.
* Queries restricted to consistent subgraphs are unaffected.
* Aboutness equivalence ignores `⋈` flags by default; a *strict* variant `≈̇_⋈` demands equality of flags.

**Policy hook.** A labeled rule (Authority/Recency/Minimal‑change) adds `◦` to selected facts, removing `⋈` and re‑including the edge in ANF.

---

## Page 11 — Metrics and kernels on `|t|`

For retrieval and clustering:

* **Edge Jaccard**: `J(H,H′)=|E∩E′|/|E∪E′|` after ANF.
* **Role‑aware edit distance** with cost function respecting roles.
* **Weisfeiler‑Lehman kernel** adapted to `(label,roles)` edge colors.
* **Hypergraph Gromov kernel** via role‑aligned incidence tensors.
* **Aboutness cosine**: embed labels via a distributional model and average per role; compare by cosine.

All metrics are `≈̇`‑invariant by construction (computed on ANF or factor by torsion action).

---

## Page 12 — Algorithmic extraction (linear‑time pass)

Input: typed 𝒞\_A AST with resolved roles.

Algorithm (per node):

1. Emit or look up vertices for anchors.
2. For `R(x₁,…,x_k)`, emit edge with signature `σ(R)` and ordered vertex list.
3. For `meta‑of`, emit reification vertex for `R` if needed, plus `meta‑edge`.
4. For `anti`, tag edge and skip descent.
5. For `para`, record composed label or separate edges per policy.
6. For `regen`, mint new vertex and lineage edge.

Complexity: `O(|t|)` vertices/edges; memory linear in node count.

---

## Page 13 — Synonym induction from data

`G_syn` may be learned:

* **Distributional**: two labels `ℓ₁,ℓ₂` share roles and have similar contextual embeddings.
* **Alignment**: maximize aboutness overlap on a parallel corpus; propose `ℓ₁↔ℓ₂` if `J` exceeds threshold.
* **Ablation**: replace `ℓ₁` with `ℓ₂` and measure derivation invariants; accept if proofs persist.

Induced pairs are added to `D*` with confidence weights, used only when above a floor.

---

## Page 14 — Worked examples I (containment/contact)

Let `Cat, Mat, Box : Thing`.

1. `on(Cat,Mat)` vs `atop(Cat,Mat)`.

* Same roles; `D*` maps `atop→on`. `|·|` edges identical after labeling; hence `≈̇`.

2. `in(Cat,Box)` vs `inside(Cat,Box)`.

* Same roles; torsion action relabels; `≈̇`.

3. `in(Cat,Box) ∧ on(Cat,Box)`.

* Coherence requires `Surface(Box)`. If absent, mark `⋈` on one edge; strict equivalence `≈̇_⋈` distinguishes; default `≈̇` ignores flags and keeps anchors/roles.

---

## Page 15 — Worked examples II (meta & regen)

4. `meta‑of(on)(Cat, r̂)` and `why(on(Cat,Mat))`.

* First adds a `meta‑edge` to relation object; second adds no aboutness edge for `why`. They are *not* `≈̇`‑equivalent; aboutness differs.

5. `regen(Cat)` within a scene.

* Adds lineage edge `(Cat → Cat′)`; both scenes without and with regen share most edges but are not `≈̇` unless regen edges are quotiented by policy.

6. `para‑through(through, across)` vs chained path edges.

* After canonicalization, aboutness includes both edges or a composed label; either way ANF equality holds → `≈̇`.

---

## Page 16 — Proof sketches

**Equivariance (Thm 1).** Induction on syntax. Base cases map labels; inductive cases compose functorially; torsion acts only on `σ.label`, commuting with `|·|`.

**Congruence.** If `t₁≈̇t₂`, then `|C[t₁]|` and `|C[t₂]|` glue the same subgraph into the same context footprint; isomorphism extends by identity on context vertices.

**Paraconsistent isolation.** Since `⋈` lives in `σ` flags not used for vertex/role matching, default `≈̇` is insensitive to contradictory truth while sensitive to anchors/roles.

**Normalization invariance.** `para` reassociation and `meta` hoist alter only labeling strata; vertex/role incidence is unchanged.

---

## Page 17 — Test harness

Property tests:

* **P1 (Functoriality).** `canon(|C[t]|) = glue(canon(|C|), canon(|t|))`.
* **P2 (Torsion invariance).** For each `(ℓ₁,ℓ₂)∈D*`, replacing labels yields `≈̇`.
* **P3 (Para hoist).** Normalization leaves `|·|` unchanged up to isomorphism.
* **P4 (Paraconsistency).** Introducing `⋈` does not affect `≈̇` unless strict mode.
* **P5 (Idempotence).** `canon(canon(H))=canon(H)`.

Fuzzing:

* Random relator graphs with role constraints; apply random torsion/assoc/hoist; check invariants.

Benchmarks:

* `Edge Jaccard`, `WL kernel` correlation with human paraphrase sets.

# MetaPrincipia Autopoiētica — Part II: Axioms of Semantic Recursion

## §6. Recursive Axioms of Meaning — Extensional · Intensional · Aboutness; Composition Laws; Regen Coherence (Twenty‑Page Slab, v0.1)

> **Thesis.** Meaning in 𝒞\_A is a **tri‑layered** semantic object `(⟦t⟧_E, ⟦t⟧_I, |t|)` where: `⟦·⟧_E` is extensional (model‑theoretic), `⟦·⟧_I` is intensional (world‑indexed), and `|·|` is aboutness (typed role‑hypergraph). Axioms ensure these layers compose homomorphically, align under modal/context shifts, and **cohere under regeneration** (object creation) and meta‑operators. The section states the axioms, gives categorical anchors, and proves layer‑compatibility and coherence theorems.

**Standing from Part I/§5:** sorts, roles, relators; tower stratification; paraconsistent `Prop_⋈`; aboutness `≈̇`; Scene category; torsion actions.

## Page 1 — Layered semantics overview

We interpret each well‑typed term `t` as a **triple**

```
S(t) = (⟦t⟧_E, ⟦t⟧_I, |t|) ∈ Ext × Int × Hyp
```

with a **master functor** `S : Syn → Ext×Int×Hyp` from syntax to the product category. Projection functors are `π_E, π_I, π_A`. Composition laws must satisfy **Tri‑Homomorphism**:

```
S(C[t1,…,tn]) = F_C(S(t1),…,S(tn))
```

for a constructor‑specific functor `F_C` that acts componentwise and respects level guards. This section makes `F_C` explicit for 𝒞\_A’s constructors.

---

## Page 2 — Extensional layer `E`

A classical Tarskian model `M = ⟨D, P^M, R^M, …⟩` with domain `D≠∅`, primitive predicates/relators interpreted as relations over `D` with typed roles. Denotations under assignment `g`:

```
⟦a⟧_E = g(a) ∈ D
⟦P(a)⟧_E = 1 ⇔ ⟦a⟧_E ∈ P^M
⟦R(a,b)⟧_E = 1 ⇔ (⟦a⟧_E,⟦b⟧_E) ∈ R^M
```

Quantifiers as usual; modalities via `□,◇` deferred to Int layer but admissible by lifting to Kripke frames when needed.

---

## Page 3 — Intensional layer `I`

A Kripke/Montague structure `K = ⟨W, R_acc, D_w, …⟩` with constant or varying domains. Intensions are world‑indexed functions:

```
⟦t⟧_I : W → Val
⟦φ⟧_I(w) ∈ {0,1}
⟦□φ⟧_I(w)=1 ⇔ ∀w′(wR_acc w′ → ⟦φ⟧_I(w′)=1)
⟦◇φ⟧_I(w)=1 ⇔ ∃w′(wR_acc w′ ∧ ⟦φ⟧_I(w′)=1)
```

We require **projection compatibility**: if `I` has constant domains and `E` picks a base world `w0`, then `⟦·⟧_E = ⟦·⟧_I(w0)` on ground atoms.

---

## Page 4 — Aboutness layer `A`

`|t|` is a typed role‑hypergraph (Part II §5). The translation is compositional; logical connectives do not introduce new relation edges; meta‑operators produce specialized edges. We write `canon(|t|)` for Aboutness Normal Form (ANF). The layer provides *structure* independent of truth.

---

## Page 5 — Product category and master functor

Let `Ext, Int, Hyp` be categories of the three layers. The product category `Ext×Int×Hyp` has objectwise identities and composition. Define `S : Syn → Ext×Int×Hyp` by constructors:

```
S(a) = (⟦a⟧_E, ⟦a⟧_I, |a|)
S(R(t1,t2)) = (R_E(…), R_I(…), |R|(…))
…
```

**Axiom RA‑0 (Tri‑Functoriality).** `S` preserves identities and composition of substitutions; projections `π_*∘S` match the per‑layer clauses below.

---

## Page 6 — Core recursive axioms (RA‑block 1)

All axioms assume well‑typedness and tower guards.

**RA‑1 (Atomic concordance).** For atoms/predicates/relators, `π_E∘S` matches Tarskian truth, `π_I∘S` matches Kripke intensions, `π_A∘S` yields the signature‑respecting hyperedge.

**RA‑2 (Compositionality).** For any constructor `C`, `S(C(t1,…,tn)) = F_C(S(t1),…,S(tn))` where `F_C` acts componentwise with layer‑appropriate operators defined in RA‑blocks below.

**RA‑3 (Projection soundness).** If `⟦φ⟧_E=1` then `⟦φ⟧_I(w0)=1` for the chosen base world `w0`; conversely when `I` has constant domains and rigid designators.

**RA‑4 (Aboutness homomorphism).** The aboutness translation is a *lax monoidal functor*: `|t⊗u| ≅ |t| ⊔ |u|` with edge disjoint union and role‑consistent gluing.

---

## Page 7 — Logical connectives & modality (RA‑block 2)

**RA‑5 (Booleans).**

```
⟦¬φ⟧_E = 1-⟦φ⟧_E;   ⟦φ∧ψ⟧_E = min(⟦φ⟧_E,⟦ψ⟧_E);   …
⟦¬φ⟧_I(w) = 1-⟦φ⟧_I(w);  …
|¬φ| = |φ|;  |φ∧ψ| = glue(|φ|,|ψ|);  …
```

**RA‑6 (Quantifiers).** Usual Tarskian/Montague clauses; aboutness does not add edges for binding, only anchor references.

**RA‑7 (Modal coherence).** If `⟦φ⟧_I` is constant across `R_acc`‑reachable worlds, then `⟦□φ⟧_I = ⟦φ⟧_I` and aboutness unchanged: `|□φ| ≈̇ |φ|`.

**RA‑8 (Paraconsistent projection).** In `Prop_⋈`, `⟦·⟧_E` and `⟦·⟧_I` are evaluated per policy; `|·|` ignores `⋈` flags unless strict mode is enabled.

---

## Page 8 — Relators & composition (RA‑block 3)

**RA‑9 (Relator application).**

```
⟦R(a,b)⟧_E=1 ⇔ (⟦a⟧_E,⟦b⟧_E)∈R^M
⟦R(t1,t2)⟧_I(w) = 1 ⇔ (⟦t1⟧_I(w),⟦t2⟧_I(w)) ∈ R^M_w
|R(t1,t2)| adds edge σ(R) incident to |t1|,|t2|
```

**RA‑10 (Para‑through = composition).**

```
⟦para‑through(R,S)⟧_E = S_E∘R_E;
⟦para‑through(R,S)⟧_I(w) = S_I(w)∘R_I(w);
|para‑through(R,S)| ≈̇ compose(|R|,|S|)
```

**RA‑11 (Associativity).** Composition reassociation preserves all layers; aboutness up to isomorphism (ANF).

## Page 9 — Meta‑operators (RA‑block 4)

**RA‑12 (meta‑of).**

```
⟦meta‑of(R)(a, r̂)⟧_E = 1 ⇔ holds_E(r̂, ⟦a⟧_E)
⟦meta‑of(R)(a, r̂)⟧_I(w) = 1 ⇔ holds_I(r̂, ⟦a⟧_I(w))
|meta‑of(R)(a, r̂)| adds meta‑edge from |a| to r̂
```

**RA‑13 (anti).** Freezes evaluation: extensional/intensional clauses are **undefined** until barrier discharge; aboutness carries an `anti` edge with pointer to the frozen site.

**RA‑14 (trans).** Orientation/dual operator; semantics given by declared relator class; aboutness relabels (`trans` flag) without changing anchors.

**RA‑16 (Meta‑interrogatives).** `meta‑what(R)` asks over relations‑as‑objects; aboutness adds a meta‑edge; extensional/intensional return sets of relation objects.

---

## Page 11 — Regen operator semantics (state, coalgebra)

`regen : Thing → Thing` creates a fresh object linked by lineage.

**State model.** Configurations `(Σ, t)` with `Σ = ⟨N,L,K⟩` (name supply, lineage, knowledge). Small‑step (from §4 fix):

```
(Σ, regen(x)) ↦ (Σ[x′:=fresh], x′),   L := L ∪ {(x→x′)}
```

**Coalgebraic view.** Let `F(X) = Σ × X`. Programs denote **coalgebras** `c : X → F(X)`. `regen` corresponds to a coalgebra map that extends lineage.

**RA‑17 (Regen extensional).**

```
⟦regen(a)⟧_E = a′ with a′∉D, extend M to M′ with D′=D∪{a′}, lineage(a,a′)
```

**RA‑18 (Regen intensional).**

```
⟦regen(a)⟧_I(w) = a′_w, coherent across w by policy (rigid vs non‑rigid creation)
```

**RA‑19 (Regen aboutness).** `|regen(a)|` adds vertex `v′` and edge labeled `regen(parent,child)` from `|a|` to `v′`.

---

## Page 12 — Regen coherence across layers

**Theorem RC‑1 (Lineage coherence).** If `⟦regen(a)⟧_E = a′` and `⟦regen(a)⟧_I(w)=a′_w` with rigid policy (`a′_w = a′`), then there exists a unique vertex `v′` such that anchors align: `v′` denotes `a′` and supports all incident edges of `|regen(a)|`.

**Theorem RC‑2 (Aboutness preservation under regen contexts).** For any context `C[·]` that does not discard the child, `|C[regen(a)]|` ≈̇ `glue(|C[a]|, regen‑edge)` (ANF equal modulo new vertex id). Proof: functoriality of `|·|` and locality of regen.

**RC‑3 (Commutation with composition).** For relators `R`, `|R(regen(a), b)|` equals ANF of `|regen(a)| ⊔ |R(a,b)|` with the child wired in place of `a` where the context demands; extensional/intensional clauses use `a′` consistently.

---

## Page 13 — Fixpoints (μ, ν) and guarded recursion

Add μ‑calculus style forms for recursive meaning:

```
μX. φ(X)   (least fixpoint)
νX. φ(X)   (greatest fixpoint)
```

**RA‑20 (Guardedness).** Every recursive variable occurrence is under a relator or modality that is **contractive** in the layer metric (see Page 11 metrics), ensuring existence/uniqueness of fixpoints.

Layer clauses:

* **Extensional:** interpret as least/greatest sets satisfying the monotone operator induced by `φ`.
* **Intensional:** do this pointwise over worlds (or over `R_acc`‑closed sets of worlds).
* **Aboutness:** union of the limit of finite unfoldings; ANF stabilizes under canonical edge deduplication.

**Fixpoint coherence.** Projections of `S(μX.φ)` equal the corresponding fixpoints of projected operators.

---

## Page 14 — Normalization & layer soundness

**Theorem (Layer soundness of normalization).** Rewriting by ℛ\_A (assoc/hoist/factor/β/fold‑unfold) preserves all three layers: extensional truth values, intensional intensions, and aboutness ANF. Sketch: each rule is either a congruence in `Ext/Int` or a label/topology change that `Hyp` quotients by isomorphism.

**Corollary (Tri‑soundness).** If `t ≡ t′` by ℛ\_A, then `S(t) = S(t′)` in `Ext×Int×Hyp` modulo isomorphism in the `Hyp` component.

---

## Page 15 — Categorical proofs (naturality, monoidality)

Let `Scene` be the category of role‑typed anchors and relators (Part I). Then:

* `π_E∘S` is a (lax) **monoidal functor** preserving `⊗` up to model‑specific isomorphism.
* `π_I∘S` is a **Kripke‑enriched** functor respecting `R_acc`.
* `π_A∘S` is a **lax monoidal functor** `Syn→Hyp` with `|t⊗u| ≅ |t| ⊔ |u|`.
* `S` factors through the product and preserves identities and composition.

**Naturality of meta‑of.** The square with reification carrier commutes; `meta` is an endofunctor on the relator subcategory with a natural transformation to satisfaction.

---

## Page 16 — Paraconsistent compatibility

Under `Prop_⋈`:

* `π_E, π_I` evaluate with consistency operator `◦` and collapse policy when needed.
* `π_A` excludes `⋈` edges by default; strict mode `≈̇_⋈` requires flag equality.

**Theorem (Non‑explosion of S).** If `Γ ⊢⋈ φ` and `Γ ⊢⋈ ¬φ`, then neither projection forces equality of contradictory layer values unless `◦φ` is asserted by policy. `Hyp` remains well‑defined and finite.

---

## Page 17 — Algorithms & evaluation contexts

**Call‑by‑meaning** evaluation contexts (Part I §4) propagate layer effects in a left‑to‑right, barrier‑respecting order. Implementation outline:

1. Compute `S` bottom‑up; memoize per subterm.
2. Apply ℛ\_A normalization; re‑use cached `|·|` with ANF to avoid recompute.
3. For regen, thread state `Σ`; for pure expressions reuse `Σ`.

Complexities: extensional truth checking depends on model ops; intensional `O(|W|)` worst‑case; aboutness linear in edges with `O(|E| log |E|)` for ANF.

---

## Page 18 — Worked examples

Let `Cat, Mat, Box` be anchors; `Sit:Thing→Prop`; relators `on, in`.

1. **Simple composition.**

```
S(on(Cat,Mat)) = (1_M, 1_K(w0), edge(on; Cat→Mat))
```

2. **Meta‑talk.**

```
S(meta‑of(on)(Cat, r̂_on)) = (holds_E(r̂_on, Cat), holds_I(…), meta‑edge(Cat→r̂_on))
```

3. **Regen in context.**

```
S(on(regen(Cat), Mat)) = (on(a′,Mat), on_I(a′_w,Mat_w), |regen(Cat)| ⊔ edge(on; a′→Mat))
```

4. **Fixpoint (path‑reachability).** Let `φ(X) = (x=y) ∨ ∃z (R(x,z) ∧ X(z,y))`.

```
S(μX.φ) projects to the usual reflexive‑transitive closure in Ext/Int; aboutness unions edges of finite R‑paths.
```

---

## Page 19 — Test harness & checklists

**Property tests.**

* Tri‑functoriality: `S(C[t]) = F_C(S(t))` componentwise.
* Normalization soundness: `S(t)=S(norm(t))`.
* Regen coherence: `S(C[regen(a)])` equals stitched result.
* Torsion invariance: `π_A` unchanged up to label action; `π_E, π_I` unchanged when torsion is a definitional synonym.
* Fixpoint convergence: unfolding stabilizes under ANF and extensional monotonicity.

**Runtime checks.**

* Layer caches hit rate; ANF idempotence; paraconsistent isolation size.

---

## Page 20 — Next‑step plan

1. Implement `S` with memoization and ANF caches; expose hooks for `meta`, `para`, `regen`.
2. Build fixpoint engine with guardedness checks; provide per‑layer evaluators.
3. Add model policies for regen rigidity and paraconsistent collapse; benchmark invariants.

## §7. Meta‑Coherence & Collapse Control — Paraconsistent Tension (⋈), Barrier Logic, Safe Self‑Reference (Twenty‑Page Slab, v0.1)

---

## Page 1 — Overview & goals

We aim to: (i) permit contradictory content without trivialization, (ii) preserve compositional meaning outside contradictory loci, (iii) provide explicit, auditable **collapse** mechanisms that reconcile conflicts, and (iv) enable **safe self‑reference** without meta‑level leakage.

---

## Page 2 — Judgments & symbols

Judgments over context `Γ`:

* Classical: `Γ ⊢ φ`
* Paraconsistent: `Γ ⊢⋈ φ`
* Consistency: `Γ ⊢ ◦φ` ("φ behaves classically inside Γ")
* Collapse decision: `Γ ⊢ choice(φ) ∈ {φ,¬φ}`

Markers and operators:

* Tension flag `⋈` on edges/facts.
* Barrier `anti⟨t⟩` blocks evaluation inside `t`.
* Reify `RelObj, PropObj` carriers.
* Levels `@ℓ` with up‑lift `↑` and explicit down‑map `↓` only on approved carriers.

---

## Page 3 — Paraconsistent base (LFI‑style)

Language: propositional with `¬,∧,∨,→`, extended later with quantifiers and relators.

Sequent rules (selected):

```
Γ ⊢⋈ φ      Γ ⊢⋈ ψ          Γ ⊢⋈ φ
———————  ————————————   ————————————————
Γ ⊢⋈ φ∧ψ     Γ ⊢⋈ φ∨ψ        Γ, φ ⊢⋈ ψ ⇒ Γ ⊢⋈ φ→ψ

Γ ⊢⋈ φ    Γ ⊢⋈ ¬φ     (no EFQ)
———————————————
Γ ⊬⋈ ψ

Γ ⊢ ◦φ    Γ ⊢⋈ φ      Γ ⊢⋈ ¬φ
———————————————  —————————
Γ ⊢ φ           Γ ⊢ ¬φ
```

`◦` is not derivable from `¬¬φ→φ`; it is a **primitive** predicate licensed by policy or meta‑proof.

Sound semantics given on Page 4.

---

## Page 4 — Semantics of tension (⋈)

Use **pair‑of‑sets semantics** (Logics of Formal Inconsistency): a valuation `v` assigns each formula a pair `(T,F)` with `T,F ⊆ World` (or booleans in a single world). Truth: `φ` holds iff `w∈T`; falsity iff `w∈F`. Tension means both.

Connectives (single world case):

```
T(¬φ)=F(φ)     F(¬φ)=T(φ)
T(φ∧ψ)=T(φ)∧T(ψ)     F(φ∧ψ)=F(φ)∨F(ψ)
T(φ∨ψ)=T(φ)∨T(ψ)     F(φ∨ψ)=F(φ)∧F(ψ)
T(φ→ψ)=F(φ)∨T(ψ)     F(φ→ψ)=T(φ)∧F(ψ)
```

`◦φ` is true iff not (T(φ) and F(φ)). Explosion is blocked because entailment uses truth preservation **without** the `T(φ)∧F(φ)⇒⊤` shortcut.

---

## Page 5 — Isolation discipline & zones

Partition a scene into **zones** `Z` with membranes `∂Z`. Each assertion edge belongs to exactly one zone. Rules:

* `⋈` stays **local**: contradictory facts must share a zone id.
* **Zone monotonicity**: information can be **imported** into a zone through membranes only via **gates** (barriers discharged) or **views** (read‑only projections).
* **No cross‑zone EFQ**: contradictions in `Z` do not license theorems in `Z′≠Z`.

Aboutness records `zone(e)`; canonicalization of `|·|` ignores `⋈` edges unless strict mode.

---

## Page 6 — Barrier calculus (syntax/typing)

Syntax:

```
anti⟨t⟩      barrier introduction
release⟨t⟩   schedule a discharge of the nearest enclosing barrier
fuse⟨t,u⟩    merge two zones under policy
```

Typing (sketch):

```
Γ ⊢ t:τ ⇒ Γ ⊢ anti⟨t⟩ : τ^bar
Γ ⊢ t:τ^bar ⇒ Γ ⊢ release⟨t⟩ : τ
Γ ⊢ t:Zone, u:Zone ⇒ Γ ⊢ fuse⟨t,u⟩ : Zone
```

Barred types `τ^bar` are **opaque**: no eliminations except `release` and transport through `anti`‑safe operators.

---

## Page 7 — Barrier small‑step SOS

Configurations `(Σ, t)` with zone stack `Zs`. Rules:

```
[E‑Anti]
(Σ; Zs, anti⟨t⟩) ↦ (Σ; Zs·Z_new, t)     // enter new isolated zone

[E‑Release]
(Σ; Zs·Z, release⟨v⟩) ↦ (Σ; Zs, v)       // leave zone when value reached

[E‑Fuse]
(Σ; Zs, fuse⟨Z_i, Z_j⟩) ↦ (Σ; Zs[Z_i←Z_i∪Z_j], unit)  // policy‑checked
```

Evaluation under barriers: reductions **cannot** cross `anti` unless the redex is inside the same zone. Rewriting rules ℛ\_A apply **per zone**.

---

## Page 8 — Collapse policies

A **collapse** resolves `⋈` into a classical commitment. Policies are explicit predicates over `(Γ, φ, meta)` returning an action.

* **Authority**: prefer facts with higher source authority metric.
* **Recency**: prefer newest timestamp.
* **Minimal‑Change**: choose resolution minimizing a change functional `Δ(Γ, choice)` (e.g., Hamming distance on edge truth values weighted by confidence).

Formal rule:

```
[Collapse]
Γ ⊢⋈ φ   Γ ⊢⋈ ¬φ   Policy(Γ,φ)=pick(χ) ∈ {φ,¬φ}
———————————————————————————————————————————————
Γ ⊢ ◦φ   Γ ⊢ χ
```

`Policy` can be multi‑criteria with ties → postpone or split into subzones.

---

## Page 9 — Non‑explosion & coherence lemmas

**Lemma 1 (Local Non‑Explosion).** If `Γ ⊢⋈ φ` and `Γ ⊢⋈ ¬φ` in zone `Z`, then for any `ψ` not in `Z`, `Γ ⊬ ψ`. Proof by semantics: truth of `ψ` is independent of `T(φ)∧F(φ)` in `Z`.

**Lemma 2 (Barrier Preservation).** If `Γ ⊢ t:τ` and `t ↦ t′` under zone stack `Zs`, then the top of `Zs` is unchanged unless the step is `[E‑Release]`. Hence isolation is stable.

**Lemma 3 (Collapse Soundness).** If `[Collapse]` fires, then `◦φ` holds and standard classical rules for `φ` are admissible within `Z`.

---

## Page 10 — Meta‑operator interaction laws

**M‑1 (Meta commutes with isolation).** `anti⟨meta‑of(R)(…)⟩ ≡ meta‑of(R)(anti⟨…⟩)` up to barrier annotations if `R` has no side effects. Aboutness adds the same meta edge; zone ids differ only by the enclosing zone.

**M‑2 (Para inside barriers).** `para‑through` composes only edges **within** the same zone; cross‑zone composition requires `fuse` or a read‑only **view** morphism.

**M‑3 (Trans & Anti).** `trans(anti⟨R⟩) ≡ anti⟨trans(R)⟩` by value opacity.

---

## Page 11 — Tower rule & predicativity guard

Levels `@ℓ` with up‑lift on meta‑constructors. **No operator** consumes arguments of strictly greater level without explicit `↓` on approved carriers.

**Predicativity Guard.** Quantification over `RelObj_ℓ` lifts the formula to level `ℓ+1`. No carrier maps `Prop@ℓ+1` that quantifies over *all* `RelObj_ℓ` back to level `ℓ`. This blocks self‑totalization.

**Lemma (Non‑collapse of tower).** In closed, well‑typed terms with no `↓`, evaluation cannot produce a same‑level self‑application of a meta‑lift.

---

## Page 12 — Safe self‑reference schemas

**Diagonal with carrier.** For a predicate `P@ℓ` over `PropObj_ℓ`, define at `ℓ+1`:

```
Diag_P ≔ λx. P(quote(x))
```

Then talk about `P` applied to its own quotation lives at `ℓ+1`. Any truth predicate `Tr@ℓ+1` may discuss `φ@ℓ` via reification `quote(φ)` without violating the guard.

**Guarded Y.** A fixpoint at level `ℓ` uses a guarded combinator `Y_bar` that forces **one barrier** between self‑calls:

```
Y_bar(F) ≔ let f = λx. F(anti⟨x⟩) in f(μ)  // μ is a seed; recursion peers behind a barrier
```

Termination/normalization arguments use barrier opacity + ℛ\_A termination per zone.

---

## Page 13 — Rewrite/coherence with ℛ\_A

ℛ\_A rules (assoc/hoist/factor/β/fold‑unfold) operate **per zone**. Critical pairs across zones cannot arise. Confluence is inherited zone‑wise; global confluence holds up to independent interleaving.

**Theorem (Normalization with barriers).** If each zone’s rewrite system terminates and is locally confluent, then the whole evaluation is strongly normalizing w\.r.t. a lexicographic sum over zones.

---

## Page 14 — Algorithms (detection/collapse)

**Tension detection.** Maintain for each zone `Z` the set `C_Z = {φ | Γ ⊢⋈ φ ∧ Γ ⊢⋈ ¬φ}`. Update incrementally as facts arrive.

**Collapse solver.** For each `φ∈C_Z`, compute candidates scored by `Policy`. Choose argmax; if tie, spawn subzones `Z₁,Z₂` with opposite choices.

**Complexity.** Detection is linear in updates; policy scoring depends on feature computation (authority, time, Δ). Collapse is per‑formula; parallelizable across `C_Z`.

---

## Page 15 — Worked examples I (Liar/Russell)

**Liar (safe form).** Let `Say(α,φ)` and `Truth(r̂,φ)` at level `ℓ+1`. The sentence “This is false” becomes a reified object `s` with `Says(s,¬True(s))`. Contradiction stays in zone `Z_liar` with `⋈`. No cross‑zone explosion. Collapse requires a policy; otherwise remain paraconsistent.

**Russell‑like.** `R(x) ≔ ¬In(x,x)` with set membership reified at `ℓ+1`. Self‑membership queries route through carriers and live in a dedicated zone; blocked from collapsing the universe by the predicativity guard.

---

## Page 16 — Worked examples II (dialogue & source fusion)

Two sources assert `at(Location, Event)` and its negation with different timestamps and authorities. Zones per source; `fuse` under policy → collapse picks the more authoritative/recent; `◦` introduced; downstream deductions become classical in fused zone while other zones remain unaffected.

---

## Page 17 — Categorical view (adhesive subcategory, DPO)

Let `Hyp` be the category of typed role‑hypergraphs. Barriers define an **adhesive subcategory** where pushouts along monos exist (zones as components). Rewriting is **double‑pushout (DPO)** inside zones. Collapse corresponds to a **pushout complement** choice guided by `Policy`. Functor `S` preserves these constructions up to isomorphism.

---

## Page 18 — Proof sketches

* **Local Non‑Explosion** by pair‑of‑sets semantics; entailment ignores `T∧F` unless `◦`.
* **Barrier Preservation** by induction on evaluation steps; only `[E‑Release]` alters the zone stack.
* **Collapse Soundness** by replacing paraconsistent evaluation with classical inside a zone after `◦φ`.
* **Tower Non‑Collapse** by level‑monotone evaluation; no rule decreases level without `↓`.

---

## Page 19 — Test harness

**Property tests.**

* P1: Contradiction isolation — add `φ,¬φ` in `Z`; verify unrelated `ψ` in `Z′` is unchanged.
* P2: Barrier opacity — no redex crosses `anti`.
* P3: Collapse soundness — after policy, classical derivations hold; before, EFQ blocked.
* P4: Tower guard — attempts at self‑totalization fail typing.
* P5: Zone‑wise confluence — normalization commutes across zones.

**Metrics.** Tension volume `|C_Z|`, collapse rate, average time to resolution, cross‑zone flux.

---

## Page 20 — Next‑step plan

1. Implement barrier stack and zone‑tagged facts with incremental tension detection.
2. Provide pluggable policies with proofs of admissibility; log decisions.
3. Integrate with §5/§6 layers; export strict vs default `≈̇` and collapse traces for audits.

## §8. The Regen Monad & Constructive Incompleteness — `T = R∘U` as Semantic Compressor; Incompleteness as Generative Affordance (Twenty‑Page Slab, v0.1)

> **Thesis.** Meaning systems that *rebuild themselves* benefit from **controlled incompleteness**. We formalize a regeneration pipeline as a **monad** `T = R∘U` where `U` *unbinds/unfolds* structure into latent carriers, and `R` *rebinds/regenerates* canonical structure. The monad preserves aboutness, contracts intensional variation, and exposes a measured gap that fuels generative extension. Incompleteness is not a bug but an **affordance**: an actionable deficit that enables invention while maintaining meta‑coherence.

## Page 1 — Motivation & intuition

Natural systems repeatedly **compress** experience and **re‑generate** structure suitable for reuse. We capture this as `U` (unbinding/unfolding → latent) followed by `R` (reconstruction/regeneration → canonical). The composite `T = R∘U` acts as a *semantic compressor* that also reveals **what is missing**. The missing part is an explicit **incompleteness budget** that can be spent to explore alternatives, invent definitions, or reconcile contradictions under §7.

---

## Page 2 — Operators `U` and `R` (typing & intent)

We assume kinds `Thing, Rel, Prop, Scene` and aboutness graphs `Hyp`.

* **Unbinder `U`**: erase surface topology, collect latent carriers.

```
U : Scene → Latent,   U : Hyp → Codes
```

`Latent` is a typed carrier (e.g., embeddings, skeletons, templates); `Codes` is a compressed description (roles, labels, hashes, stats).

* **Regenerator `R`**: produce canonical structure from latents + policy.

```
R : Latent → Scene,   R : Codes → Hyp
```

`R` may depend on a policy π: tie‑breaking, dictionary choice, granularity, collapse (§7). We write `R_π` when policies matter.

**Typing (core cases).**

```
Γ ⊢ s : Scene     ⇒ Γ ⊢ U s : Latent
Γ ⊢ c : Codes     ⇒ Γ ⊢ R c : Hyp
Γ ⊢ x : Thing     ⇒ Γ ⊢ U x : Key ;  Γ ⊢ R (Key) : Thing′
```

Keys are reidentification tokens enabling lineage tracking.

---

## Page 3 — Category‑theoretic definition of `T`

Let `𝒮` be the category of well‑typed scenes; let `𝓛` be latents; `U : 𝒮 → 𝓛`, `R : 𝓛 → 𝒮`. The composite `T = R∘U : 𝒮 → 𝒮`.

We equip `T` with monad structure `(T, η, μ)` on `𝒮`:

* `η : Id_𝒮 ⇒ T` (*unit*).
* `μ : T∘T ⇒ T` (*multiplication*).

Intuition: `η` injects a scene as already canonical; `μ` ensures **two passes of compress‑regenerate** equal a single pass up to declared equivalences.

---

## Page 4 — Unit `η` and multiplication `μ`

**Unit `η`.** For each scene `s`, pick a canonical latent `κ(s)` s.t. `R(κ(s)) = s` in ANF. Define `η_s : s → R(U(s))` as the isomorphism witnessing that `R(U(s))` equals `s` **modulo ANF** when no policy changes occur. Practically: `η` labels edges with stable ids and copies anchors.

**Multiplication `μ`.** For each `s`,

```
μ_s : R(U(R(U(s)))) → R(U(s))
```

defined by *latent idempotence*: a second `U` compresses what is already canonical; `R` then reconstructs an isomorphic scene. `μ_s` is the ANF isomorphism and role‑preserving relabeling from §5.

---

## Page 5 — Laws and coherence

Monad laws (up to declared isomorphism `≅` in 𝒮):

```
(Left unit)   μ ∘ (ηT) ≅ id_T
(Right unit)  μ ∘ (Tη) ≅ id_T
(Assoc)       μ ∘ (Tμ) ≅ μ ∘ (μT)
```

**Regen coherence.** `T` commutes with relator composition up to ANF isomorphism:

```
T(para‑through(R,S)) ≅ para‑through(T(R), T(S))
```

**Barrier compatibility.** `T` acts **per zone** (§7); barriers are preserved: `T(anti⟨s⟩) = anti⟨T(s)⟩`.

---

## Page 6 — Tri‑layer semantics of `U, R, T`

For `S(t)=(⟦t⟧_E,⟦t⟧_I,|t|)`:

* **Extensional `E`.** `U` projects to sufficient statistics of `⟦·⟧_E` required to reconstruct truth‑equivalent structure under policy π; `R` realizes one canonical representative. `T` is truth‑preserving when π is truth‑conservative.

* **Intensional `I`.** `U` factors world variation into compact parameters; `R` re‑instantiates world‑indexed intensions consistently. `T` reduces spurious intensional variance under world‑equivariant policies.

* **Aboutness `A`.** `U` emits codes `(labels, roles, anchor‑keys, torsion‑classes)`; `R` builds ANF hypergraph. `T` preserves aboutness equivalence `≈̇` exactly (Page 7).

---

## Page 7 — Aboutness invariants & compression

**Theorem A (Aboutness preservation).** For all terms `t`, `|T(t)| ≈̇ |t|` (strict equality after ANF) provided `U` records role incidence and label torsion classes.

**Theorem B (Compression bound).** Let `size(H)` be edge count in ANF. Then `size(|T(t)|) ≤ size(|t|)` with equality iff `|t|` was already canonical.

**Corollary (Idempotence up to iso).** `T∘T ≅ T` on aboutness; follows from Theorem B and `μ`.

---

## Page 8 — Regen evaluation & small‑step SOS

Extend §6 evaluation contexts with `U`/`R` steps.

Configurations `(Σ, t)`; latent store `Λ`; policy `π`.

```
[E‑U]
(Σ, U s) ↦ (Σ[Λ←Λ∪{κ=compress(s)}], κ)

[E‑R]
(Σ, R κ) ↦ (Σ, reconstruct(κ, π))

[E‑T]
(Σ, T s) ↦ (Σ′, s′)      where (Σ, U s)↦(Σ1,κ) and (Σ1, R κ)↦(Σ′, s′)
```

Barriers: if `s` lives in zone `Z`, then `κ` inherits `Z`; regeneration happens inside `Z`.

---

## Page 9 — Constructive incompleteness schema

Let a **deficit detector** `Δ` operate on compressed latents:

```
Δ : Latent → Needs,   Needs ::= {missing‑roles, underspecified‑anchors, unresolved‑torsion, contradictory‑subgraphs}
```

**Affordance generator** `G` maps `Needs` to *tasks* or *search specifications*:

```
G : Needs → Edits,    Edits ::= {add‑edge, add‑anchor, disambiguate, propose‑synonym, request‑evidence, spawn‑zone}
```

**Constructive loop:**

```
s  --U-->  κ  --Δ/G-->  edits  --apply-->  s⁺  --T-->  canonical(s⁺)
```

Thus incompleteness is *consumed* to make novelty under policy constraints.

---

## Page 10 — Gaps, affordances, and policies

Define **gap budget** `β(s) = measure(Δ(U s))`.

* Policies allocate `β` to exploration (e.g., add paraphrase edges, allow new anchors, relax torsion).
* Under `⋈`, budgets may be spent to split zones and explore alternative collapses (§7).
* **Termination guard:** budget decays per pass to ensure eventual stabilization unless external input increases it.

**Affordance priority.** Order edits by value: close contradictions that block large subgraphs; fill role holes before adding synonyms; align with external authority when available.

---

## Page 11 — Algebra/coalgebra views (EM/Kleisli)

* **Kleisli category** `Kl(T)`: morphisms `A → T B` are *computations with regeneration*. Composition models pipelines that may add structure.
* **Eilenberg–Moore (EM) algebras**: `α : T X → X` are **canonicalizers**. Laws ensure that applying canonicalization after a regen pass is stable.
* **Coalgebra** view for `U`: observers `c : X → U X` expose latent structure without commitment; dual to `R` in practice.

**Bialgebraic picture.** Combine syntax‑driven coalgebra (`U`) with policy‑driven algebra (`R`) to get well‑behaved operational semantics.

---

## Page 12 — Learning view: bottlenecks & priors

Let `U_θ` be a learned encoder and `R_ϕ` a learned decoder/canonicalizer. Training objectives:

* **Reconstruction**: `L_rec = d(s, R_ϕ(U_θ(s)))` under ANF‑aware distance.
* **Aboutness invariance**: `L_abs = d_A(|s|, |R_ϕ(U_θ(s))|)` with graph kernel.
* **Compression**: `L_rate = λ·bits(U_θ(s))` (information bottleneck).
* **Policy alignment**: prefer outputs close to collapse policy decisions; penalize over‑invention.

`T` becomes a **variational compressor** that respects symbolic constraints while harnessing statistical priors.

---

## Page 13 — Proof sketches (soundness & stability)

**Soundness.** `T` preserves extensional truth under truth‑conservative π and preserves `≈̇` by construction. Proof: `U` stores sufficient statistics for reconstruction; `R` picks a canonical representative.

**Stability.** With decay `β_{n+1} ≤ ρ·β_n` for `ρ<1` when no new external inputs, `T`‑iterations converge to a fixed point in ANF.

**No spurious explosion.** If `s` is consistent per zone, `T(s)` is consistent; `R` never introduces `⋈` unless policy requests contrastive hypotheses.

---

## Page 14 — Algorithms & complexity

**Compression `U`.**

* Extract anchors and role incidence (linear).
* Hash labels to torsion classes via dictionary `D*` (O(|E|)).
* Record minimal sufficient statistics for `E/I` if needed.

**Regeneration `R`.**

* Rebuild ANF; re‑insert canonical labels; enforce role constraints.
* Optional: apply cost‑minimizing edits from `G(Δ(κ))`.

**Complexity.** Per pass `O(|E| log |E|)` dominated by sort/canon; edits bounded by budget.

## Page 15 — Worked examples I (lexical/scene)

**Synonym collapse.**

```
s = on(Cat,Mat) ∧ atop(Cat,Mat)
U(s) → κ = {edge(on), edge(atop)}
Δ(κ) = {torsion(on↔atop)}
G→ edit: relabel atop→on
R κ→ s′ = on(Cat,Mat)   ;  T(s)=s′
```

**Role hole fill.** `with(Agent=?, Instrument=Knife)` triggers `Δ`→`add‑Agent` affordance; `G` asks for an anchor or spawns a placeholder with low weight.

---

## Page 16 — Worked examples II (graphs/programs)

**Graph canonicalization.** Scene containing `through ∘ across` in two bracketings. `U` records composition skeleton; `R` enforces associativity to ANF; `T` normalizes.

**Program schema.** In a small language of scenes, `U` hoists let‑bindings and flattens; `R` η‑reduces and β‑normalizes under role safety, giving a compact normal program.

---

## Page 17 — Metrics & diagnostics

* **Compression ratio** `CR = size(|s|)/size(|T(s)|)`.
* **Aboutness fidelity** via WL‑kernel similarity.
* **Truth drift** `TD = 1[⟦s⟧_E ≠ ⟦T(s)⟧_E]` (should be 0 under conservative π).
* **Budget spend** and **edit provenance** logs.
* **Stability index**: change magnitude across `T` iterations.

---

## Page 18 — Failure modes & guards

* **Over‑compression**: R deletes informative distinctions. Guard with fidelity loss and strict policies on critical labels.
* **Policy bias**: canonicalization encodes unwanted norms. Require pluggable π and audit trails.
* **Latent drift**: learned `U_θ` forgets necessary structure. Enforce sufficient statistics via supervised targets.
* **Zone leakage**: R fuses across barriers. Enforce per‑zone reconstruction and explicit `fuse` only.

---

## Page 19 — Test harness

Property tests:

* Monad laws up to ANF isomorphism.
* `|T(s)|≈̇|s|` for randomized scenes.
* Stability under repeated `T` with fixed π.
* Budget decay and convergence.
* Interaction with §7 barriers and collapse.

Benchmarks:

* Canonicalization time vs size; retrieval gains using ANF; analogy clustering with `≈̇` after `T`.

---

## Page 20 — Next steps

1. Implement `U,R` modules with ANF and policy hooks; expose logs and budget accounting.
2. Add learned `U_θ,R_ϕ` with `L_rec, L_abs, L_rate` and guard losses; ablate policies π.
3. Integrate with §5/§6/§7 pipelines; release a reference implementation with JSON exports for audits.
