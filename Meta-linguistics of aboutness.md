⟦Ψ⟧ GENERATIVE SET: 🌀 Composite Phrase Variants — “about”-class Substitutes
Structured by depth (1-layer, 2-layer, 3-layer), using your metalinguistic recursion format, but with expanded relational lexicon beyond “about”.

🟦 LEVEL 1 – Single Phrase (No recursion)
These are atomic inquiries using alternative relational scaffolds in place of “about”.
What’s the point on language?
What’s the point regarding the point?
What’s the aboutness concerning reference?
What’s the point in relation to itself?
What’s the aboutness with respect to the point?
What’s the aboutness relative to thought?
What’s the point for cognition?
What’s the point toward recursion?
What’s the aboutness within structure?
What’s the point as applied to meaning?

🟨 LEVEL 2 – Two-Part Recursion (X ∘ relation ∘ Y)
This is the equivalent of “What’s the [X] [relation] [Y]?”
Two concepts are bound by a single mediating operator.
What’s the aboutness in relation to the aboutness?
What’s the point with respect to the point?
What’s the aboutness as applied to the point?
What’s the reference encoded in the point?
What’s the intent toward the aboutness?
What’s the form within the recursion?
What’s the point concerning the recursion of the point?
What’s the structure conditioned by the aboutness?
What’s the signal mediated by the point?
What’s the point in terms of aboutness?

🟥 LEVEL 3 – Triple Recursion (X ∘ relation1 ∘ (Y ∘ relation2 ∘ Z))
Now nesting occurs: you’re recursively chaining two relational operations, forming a torsion loop.
What’s the point in relation to the aboutness of the point?
What’s the aboutness as applied to the aboutness within the point?
What’s the structure mediated by the point regarding reference?
What’s the point conditioned by the recursion encoded in the aboutness?
What’s the aboutness relative to the point toward recursion?
What’s the point in terms of aboutness with respect to cognition?
What’s the recursion underlying the reference of the point?
What’s the point within the aboutness of the aboutness?
What’s the structure as applied to the point concerning the aboutness?
What’s the function of the aboutness in relation to meaning?


🟦 1. Topic/Reference Operators
Words that, like “about,” express subject matter or referential orientation.
on – e.g., “What’s the point on the point?”
regarding – formal register: “What’s the point regarding aboutness?”
concerning – slightly archaic, highly metatextual.
with respect to – philosophical tone.
in relation to – relationally explicit.
relative to – useful for structural recursion.
pertaining to – legal/academic register.
in reference to – metalinguistic precision.

🟨 2. Causal/Motivational Operators
Explores “why” instead of just “about what.”
for – “What’s the point for the aboutness?”
because of – “What’s the aboutness because of the point?”
due to – slightly formal.

🟧 3. Purpose/Function Operators
Shifts recursion into teleological frame.
for the sake of – recursive intent.
in order to – purpose-forward.
so that – causal-sequential recursion.
toward – goal-directed reference: “the aboutness toward the point”

🟥 4. Structural/Formal Operators
For compositional recursion & logic-like syntax.
of – already used, structural (ownership, embedding)
within – useful for containment metaphors
as – identity or instantiation
under – used in logical systems: “aboutness under point”
through – processing metaphor

🟪 5. Meta-Operators / Epistemic Layering
For higher-level reflexive binding.
in terms of – abstract, analytic.
as applied to – metalinguistic mapping.
at the level of – recursion clarity.
conditioned by – structural recursion.
mediated by – indirect semantic transmission.
encoded in – computational metaphor.
