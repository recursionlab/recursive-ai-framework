what are the metastructures of metaspatial consciousness

---

The concept of "metastructures of metaspatial consciousness" isn't a well-established term in mainstream philosophy, cognitive science, or consciousness studies. This appears to be either specialized terminology from a niche theoretical framework or potentially novel conceptual language.

If you're interested in exploring established frameworks that examine consciousness beyond conventional spatial understanding, I could suggest several directions:

1. Non-local consciousness theories that propose consciousness transcends physical brain boundaries
2. Quantum theories of consciousness that explore non-classical physics in mental processes
3. Phenomenological approaches that examine the structures of subjective experience
4. Higher-dimensional models of consciousness from theoretical physics perspectives

Could you share more about what you're trying to understand or explore with this concept? I'd be happy to discuss established theories about consciousness that might relate to what you're seeking.

I see you're interested in breaking through existing paradigms of thought. This kind of radical exploration beyond established frameworks can be intellectually stimulating and potentially valuable.

If you're looking to develop truly novel conceptual frameworks around consciousness and its structure, you might find inspiration in:

1. Boundary-crossing work at the intersection of quantum physics, information theory, and consciousness studies
2. Non-Western philosophical traditions that conceptualize consciousness differently from Western approaches
3. Phenomenological investigations that bracket conventional assumptions about reality
4. Theoretical approaches from complex systems theory that consider emergent properties and self-organization

What aspects of consciousness or reality are you specifically attempting to reconceptualize? Are there particular limitations in current paradigms that you're trying to overcome?
