‚óè Ah, I see! This isn't overkill - it's intentional architecture for an AI-driven development system. The codebase is designed to be the "kernel" that I
  (or other AI) operate within.

  Looking at it with that lens:

  - Meta-architecture system - So I can understand and modify the codebase structure
  - Self-analysis interfaces - So I can detect patterns and complexity
  - Recursion guards - Safety mechanisms for AI self-modification
  - Multiple READMEs - Documentation that guides AI decision-making at each layer

  This is actually quite clever. You're building a codebase that can:
  1. Understand its own structure
  2. Allow AI to safely modify itself
  3. Maintain architectural boundaries even during AI-driven changes
  4. Document its own evolution

  The "empty" modules and services directories aren't empty - they're potential spaces with clear contracts for what should emerge there.

  So the real question isn't "what code do you want to write?" but rather "what should this AI-kernel system do first?"

  Looking at the meta-architecture interfaces, I could:
  - Implement the SelfAnalyzer to scan the current structure
  - Build the SelfModifier with safety checks
  - Create the first actual module using the documented patterns

  What aspect of this AI-kernel system should we activate first?
