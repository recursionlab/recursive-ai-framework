I shit out 500 IQ all day

Here is another üß† PRL Engine Design (Paraconsistent-Reverse Logic Engine)

A hybrid logic framework combining Paraconsistent Logic with Reverse Logic Tracing to handle contradictions as navigational features rather than errors.

\---

I. System Layers

üîπ Layer 1: Paraconsistent Logic (Sensor Layer)

Accepts contradictions without explosion.

Tracks logical instability via contradiction sites.

Logic basis: LP (Priest‚Äôs Logic of Paradox), da Costa‚Äôs C‚ÇÅ, or similar.

Ternary Truth Values:

T = True

F = False

B = Both (P ‚àß ¬¨P)

üîπ Layer 2: Reverse Logic (Triangulation Layer)

Traces logic backwards from contradictions.

Uses contradiction as signal to find minimal inconsistent subsets.

Inverts proof graph to discover implicit assumptions.

II. Core Structures

üî∏ Proposition Representation

class Proposition: def init (self, name): self.name = name self.truth = None # T, F, B self.parents = set() # Inference origins self.children = set() # Inferred consequents self.meta\_tags = set()

üî∏ Inference Engine (Forward + Reverse)

class InferenceEngine: def init (self): self.knowledge\_base = {}

def add\_proposition(self, prop): self.knowledge\_base\[prop.name\] = prop

def infer(self, parent\_names, child\_name): child = self.knowledge\_base.get(child\_name, Proposition(child\_name)) for p in parent\_names: parent = self.knowledge\_base.get(p) if parent: parent.children.add(child) child.parents.add(parent) self.knowledge\_base\[child\_name\] = child

def trace\_backwards(self, target\_name): target = self.knowledge\_base.get(target\_name) path = \[\] visited = set() def dfs(prop): if prop.name in visited: return visited.add(prop.name) for parent in prop.parents: dfs(parent) path.append(prop.name) dfs(target) return path\[::-1\]

üî∏ Contradiction Map

Identify all propositions P where both P and ¬¨P exist.

Annotate with truth value B.

Store contradiction sites for reverse triangulation.

\---

III. Logic Heatmap (optional UI module)

Red zones = High contradiction density.

Blue zones = Stable logic.

Useful for debugging or learning system weaknesses.

\---

IV. Minimal Contradiction Set (MCS) Finder

def find\_minimal\_contradiction\_set(engine): contradictions = \[p for p in engine.knowledge\_base.values() if p.truth == 'B'\] minimal\_sets = \[\] for c in contradictions: path = engine.trace\_backwards(c.name) minimal\_sets.append(set(path)) return minimal\_sets

\---

V. Use Cases

Self-repairing AI logic engines.

Epistemic failure detectors.

Post-classical legal reasoning engines.

G√∂del-aware learning architectures.

\---

VI. Future Expansion

Integrate fuzzy truth ranges (continuum-based paraconsistency).

Incorporate intuitionistic negation and defeasible logic.

Visual UI for logic exploration (e.g. Graphviz backend).

Recursive torsion tracing (detect nested contradiction spirals).

Would you like a test scenario to validate this engine or expand the operator set next?

This is a fascinating architecture for handling logical contradictions systematically. The PRL Engine concept of treating contradictions as navigational features rather than system failures is particularly elegant - it reminds me of how robust systems in biology or engineering often incorporate failure modes as information sources.

Let me build a working implementation to test this concept:

This implementation captures the core concepts of your PRL Engine:

**Key Features Implemented:**

- **Paraconsistent Logic**: Handles contradictions with ternary truth values (T/F/B)
- **Reverse Logic Tracing**: Traces backwards from contradictions to find minimal inconsistent subsets
- **Visual Heatmap**: Color-codes propositions by contradiction proximity
- **Self-Stabilization**: Identifies and marks questionable assumptions
- **Live Demo**: Includes Russell's Paradox and Liar Paradox scenarios

**The engine demonstrates several fascinating behaviors:**

1. **Contradiction as Signal**: Instead of system failure, contradictions become information sources
2. **Depth-Based Analysis**: Traces how contradictions propagate through inference chains
3. **Assumption Identification**: Finds root assumptions that lead to contradictions
4. **Stability Metrics**: Provides quantitative measures of logical health

The visual interface shows how contradictions create "heat zones" in the logical space, making it easy to identify problematic reasoning paths. The reverse tracing feature is particularly powerful - it shows exactly how contradictions emerge from seemingly innocent premises.

This could be incredibly useful for AI systems that need to reason with incomplete or contradictory information, legal reasoning systems dealing with conflicting precedents, or any domain where classical logic's explosion problem is limiting.

What aspects would you like to explore further? The fuzzy truth ranges, intuitionistic extensions, or perhaps testing it on more complex logical scenarios?
