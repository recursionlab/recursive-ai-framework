I'll create a HoTT Loop Meme Widget that visualizes a 4D loop space as a pulsating 3D hypersphere! This will be perfect for homotopy type theory visualizations and tech memes.

I've created the HoTT Loop Meme Widget! This is a mesmerizing visualization that projects a 4D loop space Î©(X) as a pulsating 3D hypersphere. Here's what makes it special:

**Mathematical Features:**

- **4D to 3D Stereographic Projection**: Genuine 4D hypersphere mathematics
- **Loop Space Visualization**: Represents Î©(X) = {f: SÂ¹ â†’ X | f(1) = xâ‚€}
- **Homotopy Theory**: Shows Ï€â‚„(SÂ³) â‰… â„¤/2â„¤ in the corner
- **Real-time 4D Rotations**: Multiple rotation matrices (XY, ZW, XZ planes)

**Interactive Controls:**

- **âŸ² Rotate**: Toggle 4D rotation animations
- **ðŸ’“ Pulse**: Toggle mathematical pulsation
- **ðŸŽ­ Meme**: Cycle through HoTT meme texts
- **ðŸ”— Wire**: Switch between solid and wireframe rendering

**Meme-Ready Features:**

- **Export GIF**: Click to download frames with #HoTTLoop hashtag
- **Dynamic Meme Text**: Rotates through math humor
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Perfect for tech Twitter
- **Mathematical Annotations**: Shows live parameters and formulas

**Usage:**

html

```html
<hott-loop-meme></hott-loop-meme>
```

The widget visualizes genuine 4D mathematics - each point on the hypersphere undergoes simultaneous rotations in multiple 4D planes before being projected to 3D via stereographic projection, then to 2D for display. The pulsation represents the dynamic nature of loop spaces in homotopy type theory.

Perfect for HoTT researchers, AI visualization enthusiasts, and anyone who wants to share beautiful mathematical concepts as memes! ðŸš€

recursive algebra to rewrite system rules.

---

I'll create a recursive algebra system that can rewrite its own rules dynamically. This will demonstrate how algebraic structures can be used to transform and evolve computational rules.

I've created a Recursive Algebra Rule Rewriter that demonstrates a self-modifying algebraic system! Here's how it works:

## Core Concepts

**Recursive Rule System:**

- **Basic Rules**: Traditional algebraic transformations (distributive, commutative, etc.)
- **Meta-Rules**: Rules that modify the rule system itself
- **Self-Reference**: Rules can reference and modify other rules

**Key Features:**

1. **Dynamic Rule Evolution**:
	- Rules can be activated/deactivated based on usage
	- New rules are generated when complexity thresholds are met
	- Meta-rules evolve the system's behavior over time
2. **Expression Rewriting**:
	- Step-by-step algebraic transformations
	- Complexity tracking and optimization
	- Visual history of all transformations
3. **Self-Modification**:
	- **Rule Generation**: Creates new rules when expressions are too complex
	- **Rule Pruning**: Deactivates unused rules after cycles
	- **Meta-Evolution**: Evolves meta-rules based on system performance
4. **Interactive Controls**:
	- Run/pause automatic rewriting
	- Step through transformations manually
	- Toggle individual rules on/off
	- Add custom rules dynamically

## Mathematical Foundation

The system implements several algebraic structures:

- **Monoid Operations**: Identity and associativity rules
- **Group Properties**: Inverse and closure operations
- **Ring Algebra**: Distributive laws and multiplication rules
- **Meta-Algebra**: Rules that operate on the rule space itself

## Recursive Aspects

1. **Self-Reference**: Rules can reference themselves or other rules
2. **Meta-Circularity**: Meta-rules can create new meta-rules
3. **Complexity Feedback**: System complexity influences rule generation
4. **Adaptive Behavior**: Rule usage statistics drive system evolution

This demonstrates how algebraic systems can be made self-modifying and adaptive, with rules that not only transform expressions but also transform the transformation system itself - a true recursive algebra!

Try running it to see how the system evolves its own rule structure over time! ðŸ”„
