How do I stop I don't know what career to choose?

Where does I don't know what career to choose come from?

How might I don't know what career to choose be a gift?

What should I do about I don't know what career to choose?

When will I don't know what career to choose resolve?

What if there is no answer to "What is the question behind the question: "How do I solve I don't know what career to choose?"?" and that's the answer?

What is the question behind the question: "What would "What if I don't know what career to choose is actually good for me?" sound like if it was the most important question in the universe?"?

How does "Why is I don't know what career to choose happening?" spiral into itself and create new questions?

How does "What resources do I already have for I don't know what career to choose?" look from the perspective of your body, mind, and spirit separately?

What other questions are quantum entangled with "How do I stop I don't know what career to choose?"?

These questions suck, how do we do the how to how the how do we formally discuss this

I see the issue! The current implementation is mechanically inserting the problem statement into question templates, which creates awkward phrasing like "How do I stop I don't know what career to choose?"

Let me redesign this to create genuinely useful coaching questions. The key problems are:

1. **Grammatical awkwardness** - Direct substitution breaks natural language flow
2. **Lack of semantic understanding** - The system doesn't understand what type of problem it's dealing with
3. **Overly complex operators** - The "operator soup" creates confusing rather than clarifying questions

Here's a better approach:

The key improvements I made:

1. **Intelligent Question Generation**: Uses Claude API to analyze the problem and generate contextually appropriate questions
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Questions flow naturally and are grammatically correct
3. **Coaching Methodology**: Applies proven techniques like reframing, assumption challenging, and perspective shifting
4. **Categorized Questions**: Each question targets specific areas (limiting beliefs, values, etc.)
5. **Fallback System**: If the API fails, it uses curated high-quality questions
6. **Better UX**: Shows the coaching strategy behind each question

The new system understands that "I don't know what career to choose" is an identity/decision-making problem and generates questions like:

- "What would you choose if you knew you couldn't fail?"
- "What are you afraid would happen if you made the 'wrong' choice?"
- "What kind of person do you want to become through your career?"

This creates genuinely useful coaching questions instead of awkward mechanical substitutions. The AI analyzes the problem context and applies appropriate coaching techniques to generate breakthrough questions that could actually help a client gain clarity.
