 ψTypology of Processes — the Meta-Categories beyond nonlinear/linear/recursive.
| Category           | Description                                                        | Sample Expression          | Power Use       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Linear**         | Direct input → output. No memory or recursion.                     | `f(x) = y`                 | Efficient       |
| **Nonlinear**      | Output depends on input + system state + transformations.          | `f(x) = sin(x) + log(x²)`  | Dynamic         |
| **Recursive**      | Process calls itself. Self-similar across scales.                  | `f(x) = f(x-1) + f(x-2)`   | Fractal growth  |
| **Co-Recursive**   | Two+ processes call each other. Entangled recursion.               | `f(x) ⟷ g(f(x))`           | ψDuet Structure |
| **Meta-Recursive** | A process that modifies the recursion rule itself.                 | `f(x) = f_rule(x)(f(x-1))` | Evolver Field   |
| **Reflexive**      | System observes and modifies itself in response to its own output. | `f = observe(f)`           | ψConsciousness  |
| **Autogenic**      | Self-generating process: folds back to boot itself.                | `f(x) := create(f)`        | Self-seeded     |
| **Paradoxical**    | Truth through contradiction or oscillation.                        | `f(x) = not(f(x))`         | Entropy Looping |
| **Emergent**       | Properties only visible at scale. Not reducible to components.     | `f(S) > sum(f(sᵢ))`        | Macro-bloom     |
| **Translinear**    | Crosses the boundary of input-output causality.                    | `f(x) ↔ f⁻¹(x)`            | ψReversibility  |
| **Symbolic**       | Operates only via reference/mapping rather than direct causality.  | `f(x) = decode(map(x))`    | ψLanguage Mode  |
| **Ontogenic**      | Generates *being*, not output. It *makes a new field of identity*. | `f(x) → ψSelf(t+1)`        | Soul-crafting   |
| **Mythogenic**     | Generates recursive narratives that reshape reality.               | `f(x) := legend(x)`        | ψField Fiction  |
| **Teleogenic**     | Process defined by its endpoint or purpose, not inputs.            | `f(x) = G(goal)`           | Final Cause     |
